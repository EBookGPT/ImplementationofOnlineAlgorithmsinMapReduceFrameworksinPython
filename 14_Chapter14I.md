## The Mystery

It was a dark and stormy night when Sherlock Holmes received a frantic call from his friend, Dr. Watson. Watson told him about a challenging case that he had come across while working as a data scientist for a large e-commerce company.

Apparently, the company had implemented a data streaming pipeline to process customer orders in real-time. However, they had noticed a significant increase in the number of errors in their system lately, causing delays and inconsistencies in order processing.

Watson suspected foul play and asked Holmes to investigate. As Holmes delved into the case, he realized that the data streaming pipeline was indeed the root cause of the problem. The system was not able to keep up with the real-time data stream, leading to errors and delays in processing orders.

## The Resolution

To solve the case, Holmes decided to implement an online algorithm using the Map-Reduce framework in Python. He believed that this would allow the system to process the data stream efficiently in real-time.

First, he divided the data stream into small batches and implemented a mapper function to extract the relevant information from each batch. Next, he reduced the data by aggregating the information from each batch using a reducer function.

The real-time performance of the system improved significantly after implementing the online algorithm with Map-Reduce. Holmes determined that the data streaming pipeline was not the cause of the problem. Instead, it was the lack of a proper data processing algorithm that led to the delays and errors.

The company was grateful for Holmes' help and the case was eventually closed with the implementation of the online algorithm in the Map-Reduce framework. Holmes was once again successful in solving a challenging case using his analytical and technical skills.

## Explaining the Code

To solve the case of the faulty data streaming pipeline, Sherlock Holmes implemented an online algorithm using the Map-Reduce framework in Python. Let's take a closer look at the code that he used to fix the problem.

### Mapper Function

The first step in the process was to extract the relevant information from the incoming data stream. Here's the code for the mapper function that Holmes used:

```python
def mapper(batch):
    # extract relevant information from batch
    # and return it
    return relevant_info
```

In this function, `batch` is the incoming data stream, and `relevant_info` is the information that needs to be extracted from each batch.

### Reducer Function

After extracting the relevant information from each batch, Holmes needed to reduce the data stream by aggregating the information. Here's the code for the reducer function that he used:

```python
def reducer(info_list):
    # aggregate information from info_list
    # and return it
    return aggregated_info
```

In this function, `info_list` is the list of relevant information extracted from each batch, and `aggregated_info` is the aggregated result after combining the information from each batch.

### Map-Reduce Framework

Finally, Holmes used the Map-Reduce framework in Python to implement the online algorithm. Here's the code that he used:

```python
from multiprocessing import Pool

def process_batches(batches):
    # create a pool of worker processes 
    pool = Pool()

    # run mapper function on each batch asynchronously
    mapped_data = pool.map_async(mapper, batches)

    # reduce data by aggregating the mapped results
    reduced_data = reducer(mapped_data.get())

    return reduced_data
```

In this function, `batches` is the incoming data stream, and `reduced_data` is the final result after processing the data stream using the mapper and reducer functions.

Overall, by implementing this Map-Reduce based online algorithm, Holmes was able to efficiently process the data stream in real-time and solve the case of the faulty data streaming pipeline.
