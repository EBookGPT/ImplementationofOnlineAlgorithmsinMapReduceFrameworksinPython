# Chapter 16 - Statistical Analysis in Python

Greetings, dear readers! Welcome to the sixteenth chapter of "Implementation of Online Algorithms in Map-Reduce Frameworks in Python". We have a thrilling mystery to solve in this chapter, so let's dive in!

## The Mystery

One stormy evening, renowned statistician Nate Silver visited Sherlock Holmes at his residence at 221B Baker Street. Nate was in town to give a talk on the importance of data analysis and the power of statistical models. He had a pressing issue to discuss with Sherlock.

Nate revealed that he had recently noticed some strange patterns in his data analysis. He suspected that someone was tampering with his data to produce incorrect results. He asked for Sherlock's help in identifying and catching the culprit.

Sherlock immediately went to work, analyzing Nate's data sets, looking for any inconsistencies or outliers. He then applied various statistical models to the data, but nothing seemed to point to any wrongdoing.

As they were reviewing the data late into the night, a thought suddenly struck Sherlock. He remembered reading about a technique called "Reservoir Sampling". This technique is used to obtain a random sample of data from a large stream of data without storing all of the data. This technique is essential when working with extremely large data sets.

## The Resolution

Sherlock immediately dove into implementing Reservoir Sampling in Python using a Map-Reduce framework. He used the "mrjob" Python library to implement the Map-Reduce framework and used the technique of "Streaming" in Map-Reduce to analyze Nate's data streams on the fly while keeping a random sample for further analysis.

Lo and behold, as Sherlock analyzed the random sample, he found a pattern that was undetectable without Reservoir Sampling. It turned out that a member of Nate's team was intentionally introducing random errors in the data to sabotage Nate's credibility.

With this new insight, Sherlock was able to confront the culprit and bring them to justice. Nate was relieved and grateful for Sherlock's detective work, and their work together led to even more innovative statistical breakthroughs.

In this chapter, we learned about the importance of statistical analysis in detecting anomalies in data sets, and the value of using Map-Reduce frameworks to process large volumes of data. We explored the technique of Reservoir Sampling, which provides an efficient way to analyze large data sets without using all of the data, and Sherlock used this technique to solve the mystery at hand.

We hope you enjoyed this chapter, and we look forward to joining you in the next one as we continue our exploration of "Implementation of Online Algorithms in Map-Reduce Frameworks in Python" with even more mysteries to solve!
# Explanation of the Code

In the Sherlock Holmes mystery we just solved, we used Reservoir Sampling to analyze Nate Silver's data sets to identify anomalies. Let's take a closer look at the code used to implement Reservoir Sampling in Python using a Map-Reduce framework.

We used the "mrjob" Python library to implement the Map-Reduce framework. This allowed us to process large data sets in a distributed environment, which is essential for handling big data. The code consists of two stages - Map and Reduce.

### The Map Stage

In the Map stage, we implemented Reservoir Sampling by selecting a random sample from the data stream. Here is the code:

```python
import random
from mrjob.job import MRJob

class ReservoirSampling(MRJob):
    def mapper(self, _, line):
        # Select the first 'k' elements of the data stream
        if random.random() < k / total_records_seen:
            yield _, line
        else:
            # Randomly replace an element in the sample with a new data point
            replace_index = random.randint(0, total_records_seen)
            for i, record in enumerate(self.sample):
                if i == replace_index:
                    yield _, line
                else:
                    yield _, record
        total_records_seen += 1

if __name__ == '__main__':
    ReservoirSampling.run()
```

In this code, `k` is the size of the desired random sample, and `total_records_seen` is the total number of records seen so far. For the first `k` records, we yield the record with probability `1`. For the subsequent records, we randomly select a record from the current sample to replace with the new record.

### The Reduce Stage

In the Reduce stage, we analyzed the random sample to identify any anomalies. Here is the code:

```python
class StatisticalAnalysis(MRJob):
    def reducer(self, key, values):
        sample = []
        for value in values:
            sample.append(float(value))
        mean = sum(sample) / len(sample)
        variance = sum((value - mean) ** 2 for value in sample) / (len(sample) - 1)
        stdev = variance ** 0.5
        anomalies = []
        for value in sample:
            if abs(value - mean) > 3 * stdev:
                anomalies.append(value)
        yield key, anomalies

if __name__ == '__main__':
    StatisticalAnalysis.run()
```

In this code, we analyzed the distribution of the values in the sample by calculating the mean, variance, and standard deviation. We then flagged any data points that were more than `3` standard deviations from the mean as anomalies.

And that's how we implemented Reservoir Sampling to identify anomalies in a distributed data stream using Python and Map-Reduce frameworks. We hope this explanation helped you understand the code used in the Sherlock Holmes mystery we just solved!
