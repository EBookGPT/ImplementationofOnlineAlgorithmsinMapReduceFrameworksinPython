## Introduction to Online Algorithms

Welcome to the fascinating world of online algorithms! In today's digital age where big data reigns supreme, the ability to quickly and efficiently process large volumes of data is more important than ever before. Online algorithms provide a powerful framework for accomplishing this goal.

At their core, online algorithms are designed to operate on data streams that arrive one at a time, rather than as a complete dataset. This allows them to avoid the need to store and process all data at once, making them particularly well-suited for handling big data.

In this chapter, we will explore the fundamental concepts and principles underlying online algorithms. We will discuss the different types of online algorithms and how they are applied in various real-world scenarios. 

Throughout our investigation, we will use the power of Python and Map-Reduce frameworks to implement and experiment with different online algorithms. By the end of this chapter, you will understand the theory behind online algorithms and how to apply them effectively to solve big data problems. So, let's venture forth together to solve the enigma of online algorithms!
## The Mystery of the Repeating Numbers

It was a dreary afternoon in London, and Sherlock Holmes was lost in thought as he gazed out of his window. Suddenly, a loud knock at the door interrupted his musings. It was Dr. Watson, his loyal friend and companion.

"A new case, I presume?" Holmes inquired as he welcomed Watson in.

"I have just received an urgent request from the Bank of London," replied Watson. "They have been noticing repeating numbers in their financial data and have reason to believe that a fraudulent scheme is in play."

Holmes' eyes lit up with interest. "Fraudulent schemes are often difficult to detect, requiring us to examine large amounts of data in a short amount of time. This sounds like a perfect case for the use of online algorithms!"

And with that, Holmes dived into the investigation, working tirelessly to uncover the truth behind the mysterious repeating numbers. He utilized the power of Python and Map-Reduce frameworks to implement an online algorithm to analyze the bank's financial data in real-time.

As the algorithm processed the data stream, a pattern began to emerge. Holmes' keen eye for detail and sharp mind for deduction allowed him to identify a group of individuals who had been manipulating the bank's data for their own financial gain. 

Thanks to the power of online algorithms, Holmes was able to catch the culprits red-handed and bring them to justice. The Bank of London was eternally grateful for his work in uncovering the fraudulent scheme.

## Resolution

In this chapter, we introduced the concept and applications of online algorithms. We learned how these algorithms operate on data streams and how they can be used to solve big data problems by processing data in real-time. 

To demonstrate the power of online algorithms, we presented a Sherlock Holmes mystery in which an online algorithm was used to detect fraudulent activity in financial data. Thanks to the insights provided by online algorithms, Holmes was able to solve the case and bring the perpetrators to justice.

As you continue through this book, you will delve deeper into the world of online algorithms and gain a more profound understanding of how they can be harnessed to solve complex problems. With the techniques you learn here, you too can become a master of online algorithms, and bring clarity to the maze of big data.
## Code explanation: Detecting the Frauds with Online Algorithms

To catch the culprits in the Sherlock Holmes mystery, we used an online algorithm to detect fraudulent activity in the data stream. Let's take a closer look at the code behind this process.

### Set up the data stream

First, we generate a data stream of financial transactions. Here, we are simulating a stream of transactions with randomly generated transaction amounts.

```python
import random

def generate_transactions(num):
    for i in range(num):
        yield random.randint(1, 1000)
```

### Implementing the online algorithm

Next, we create an implementation of the online algorithm. In this example, we are using a simple sliding window algorithm to calculate the average of the most recent n transactions.

```python
def sliding_window_average(n, transaction):
    total = 0
    window = []
    
    for i in range(n):
        window.append(transaction)
        total += transaction
        transaction = next(transactions)
    
    for i in transactions:
        window.append(i)
        total += i
        total -= window.pop(0)
        average = total / n
        if i > average * 3:
            print(f"Fraudulent transaction detected: {i}")
```

### Using the algorithm to catch the frauds

Finally, we use the online algorithm to process the data stream and detect any fraudulent transactions.

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    transactions = generate_transactions(10000)
    sliding_window_average(10, next(transactions))
```

By calling `generate_transactions(10000)` we created a stream of 10000 financial transactions. Then, by calling `sliding_window_average(10, next(transactions))` we started running the sliding window algorithm on the first 10 transactions of the stream.

As the algorithm processes the data stream in real-time, it compares every new transaction with the average of the sliding window. In this example, if the value of any transaction is more than three times the average of the sliding window, we detect a fraudulent transaction.

### Conclusion

In the Sherlock Holmes mystery, we used the power of online algorithms to detect fraudulent activity in a stream of financial data. Utilizing only a small subset of the data at a time, we were able to process the stream in real-time to identify suspicious behavior that would otherwise have gone unnoticed. By understanding, implementing, and applying online algorithms, you too can become a master detective of big data.
