# Chapter 8: The Case of Distributed Computing in Map-Reduce

Welcome back, dear reader. In the previous chapter, we dug deep into the world of Input and Output Splits in Map-Reduce. We saw how Python code can be written to split input data into different chunks that can be processed individually across multiple machines. In this chapter, we'll be investigating the case of Distributed Computing in Map-Reduce.

When we talk about distributed computing in Map-Reduce, we refer to the process of distributing the computation tasks between multiple nodes in a cluster of computers. Each node works on its own subset of data and performs the necessary computations to generate intermediate results. These intermediate results are then combined to produce the final output.

Distributed computing in Map-Reduce has become widely used in many applications, including data processing, data warehousing, data analytics, machine learning, and many more. In this chapter, we will unravel another mystery with the help of Sherlock Holmes and learn how to implement online algorithms in Map-Reduce frameworks in Python.

So, put on your detective hats and let's get started!
# Chapter 8: The Case of Distributed Computing in Map-Reduce

Welcome back, dear reader. In the previous chapter, we dug deep into the world of Input and Output Splits in Map-Reduce. We learned how Python code can be written to split input data into different chunks that can be processed individually across multiple machines. In this chapter, we'll be investigating the case of Distributed Computing in Map-Reduce.

## The Mystery

It was a dark and stormy night in London, and Sherlock Holmes was pacing back and forth in his apartment, deep in thought. Suddenly, a knock came at the door. It was Watson, who had come to deliver an urgent message from the local bank.

"Good evening, Watson," said Holmes. "What brings you out on such a dreadful night?"

"Sorry to disturb you Holmes, but the bank has received a massive amount of transactions in the last few hours, and they need our help to process the data overnight," replied Watson.

Holmes knew that processing such a large amount of data in a short amount of time required distributed computing in Map-Reduce. He immediately set to work, analyzing the data and designing a Map-Reduce framework to process the transactions.

After writing the necessary code, Holmes ran the computation on a cluster of computers. The computation had barely begun when another problem popped up.

"Damn it!" exclaimed Holmes. "A few of the nodes in the cluster are failing to send their intermediate results back to the master node, causing the computation to fail."

Holmes knew that such failures in distributed computing could be deadly for any online algorithm. Without waiting, he started his investigation to find out why the cluster nodes were failing.

## The Resolution

Holmes quickly discovered that the cluster nodes failing to send their intermediate results back to the master node were caused by network problems. He then devised a new algorithm that would ensure the nodes resending their intermediate results to ensure that the computation would not fail.

Holmes modified the Map-Reduce code to include a retry mechanism in case a node failed to return its intermediate results. He used Python's `retry` package to implement the retries in his code.

```python
from retry import retry

@retry(RuntimeError, delay=2, jitter=1, max_delay=120)
def process_chunk(self, chunk):
    # process the given chunk of data
    ...
    # Return the intermediate results
    return results
```

With this modification, Holmes re-ran the computation, and the results came back as expected.

"Well done, Holmes!" exclaimed Watson as the two of them celebrated with a cup of hot tea.

"With the power of distributed computing in Map-Reduce, and a little bit of Python magic, no mystery can remain unsolved," replied Holmes with a smile.

## Conclusion

And there you have it, dear reader. In this chapter, we learned how to handle network issues in distributed computing tasks using Python. We also saw how to use the `retry` package to implement retries in case of failure. With this knowledge, you'll be able to solve the most challenging cases of Distributed Computing in Map-Reduce with ease.
Sure, dear reader. In the Sherlock Holmes mystery mentioned in the last section, we saw how Holmes used Python and a Map-Reduce framework to solve a distributed computing problem. In the resolution, we saw how he implemented a retry mechanism to handle node failures that were causing the computation to fail.

Here we'll take a closer look at the Python code used in the `process_chunk` function:

```python
from retry import retry

@retry(RuntimeError, delay=2, jitter=1, max_delay=120)
def process_chunk(self, chunk):
    # process the given chunk of data
    ...
    # Return the intermediate results
    return results
```

In this code, the `retry` package is used to define a retry logic for the `process_chunk` method. The `@retry` decorator wraps the function, and if an exception of the specified `RuntimeError` type occurs, the function retries the code block after a delay of `delay` seconds, where `delay` is initially 2 seconds. The value of `max_delay` specifies the maximum time between retries. 

The `jitter` parameter is used to introduce randomization in the delay between retries. This randomization helps to avoid potential collisions and bottlenecks that may arise from all nodes retrying their connection attempts at the same time.

By using this `retry` package, Holmes was able to handle network issues in real-time and ensure that the computation would not fail due to a failed node. This is just one of the many ways Python can be used in Distributed Computing in Map-Reduce.

That's it for this chapter, dear reader. We hope you found this explanation helpful in understanding the Python code used in the Sherlock Holmes mystery.
