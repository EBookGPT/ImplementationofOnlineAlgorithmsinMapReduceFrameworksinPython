# Chapter 23: Game Theoretic Algorithms for Map-Reduce

Welcome, dear reader, to the chapter on "Game Theoretic Algorithms for Map-Reduce". In this chapter, we delve into the world of game theory and explore how it can be used to solve problems in the Map-Reduce framework using Python.

Game theory is the study of mathematical models of conflict and cooperation between intelligent rational decision-makers. It has been used to analyze and understand a wide range of phenomena in various fields ranging from economics to political science to computer science. 

In recent years, game theory has found its applications in the field of distributed computing, particularly in the Map-Reduce framework. The Map-Reduce framework is a programming model and an associated implementation for processing and generating large data sets with a parallel, distributed algorithm on a cluster.

In this chapter, we will look at how game theoretic algorithms can be used in the context of Map-Reduce to solve a variety of problems including load balancing, resource allocation, and task scheduling. We will also provide examples of how game theoretic algorithms can be implemented in Python using the Map-Reduce framework.

Before diving into the main concepts and algorithms, we will first provide an overview of game theory and its relevance to distributed computing. We will then introduce the Map-Reduce framework and its basic concepts. 

So, get ready to put on your detective hats and explore the intersection of game theory and distributed computing using Python and Map-Reduce!

## Mystery: The Mysterious Server Overload

Sherlock Holmes received a distress call from a large tech company that was experiencing a server overload. The company had recently implemented a Map-Reduce framework to handle its large data sets. However, the server was experiencing a massive overload during peak hours, causing the company to lose valuable data and customers. 

Sherlock and Watson quickly arrived at the company's office and began investigating the cause of the server overload. They soon discovered that the company's Map-Reduce framework was not distributing tasks efficiently among the available machines, causing some machines to be overloaded while others were underutilized. 

As they delved deeper, they found out that the root cause of the problem lay in the lack of an effective load balancing algorithm. The company's developers had implemented a simple round-robin algorithm to distribute tasks among machines, which was suboptimal in the presence of varying processing rates of machines under high volume.

## Resolution: Implementing a Game Theoretic Algorithm

Sherlock and Watson quickly realized that the problem required an advanced algorithm to balance the load across machines efficiently. They suggested implementing a game theoretic approach that accounts for the behavior of the machines in the Map-Reduce framework. 

The game theoretic solution involves modeling the Map-Reduce framework as a non-cooperative game with players being the machines in the system. Each player makes a decision based on its payoff and seeks to maximize the payoff while minimizing costs. This game theoretic approach allows us to come up with strategies that balance the load among machines efficiently.

Sherlock and Watson pulled up some examples of game theoretic algorithms that could be implemented in Python using Map-Reduce, such as the "nth price auction" algorithm. They worked with the company's developers to implement and test the algorithm, and soon there was an improvement in the server's performance. The tasks were being distributed more effectively, and the server overload was eliminated, preventing data loss and customer churn. 

The company was now able to handle large data sets during peak hours with ease, keeping its customers happy and data secure. 

And so, the mystery of the mysterious server overload was finally solved using a game theoretic algorithm implemented in Python with the help of Map-Reduce.

## Implementing a Game Theoretic Algorithm

To implement the game theoretic algorithm, we can use Python with the Map-Reduce framework. Here's some sample code that demonstrates how to implement a "fair" load balancing algorithm using game theory:

```python
from mrjob.job import MRJob
import random

class MapReduceTaskScheduler(MRJob):

    def configure_options(self):
        super(MapReduceTaskScheduler, self).configure_options()
        self.add_passthrough_option('--num-machines', type='int', help='Number of available machines')
        self.add_passthrough_option('--max-tasks', type='int', help='Max number of tasks each machine can process')
        
    def load_tasks(self, _, data):
        for task in data.split("\n"):
            yield random.randint(1, 10), task # assign a random priority to each task
        
    def allocate_tasks(self, _, tasks):
        task_lists = [[] for i in range(self.options.num_machines)]
        max_tasks_per_machine = self.options.max_tasks
        for task in tasks:
            machine_no = random.choice(range(self.options.num_machines)) # pick a random machine
            if len(task_lists[machine_no]) < max_tasks_per_machine: # if the machine can handle more tasks
                task_lists[machine_no].append(task)
            else:
                machines = range(self.options.num_machines)
                machines.remove(machine_no)
                random_machine = random.choice(machines) # pick a random machine
                if len(task_lists[random_machine]) < max_tasks_per_machine: # if the machine can handle more tasks
                    task_lists[random_machine].append(task)                
        for i, task_list in enumerate(task_lists):
            yield i, task_list  
            
    def reduce_tasks(self, machine_no, task_lists):
        tasks = []
        for task_list in task_lists:
            tasks.extend(task_list)
        yield machine_no, tasks
        
if __name__ == '__main__':
    MapReduceTaskScheduler.run()
```

In this code, we define a MapReduceTaskScheduler class that inherits from MRJob class. The code demonstrates how a game theoretic algorithm can be implemented within the Map-Reduce framework. 

We define three methods: configure_options(), load_tasks(), and allocate_tasks(). The configure_options() method is optional but recommended in order to pass variables like the number of machines and the limit to the number of tasks each of them can process.

In the load_tasks() method, we read in the input data and assign a random priority for each task. In the allocate_tasks() method, we implement the game theory algorithm to distribute the tasks among the available machines. We first pick a random machine and check if it can handle more tasks. If it can, we assign the task to the machine. If it can't, we pick a random machine among the remaining ones, and assign the task to the machine that can still handle more tasks. 

Finally, in the reduce_tasks() method, we collect all the tasks for each machine and output each machine's task list.

By using this game theoretic algorithm, the Map-Reduce framework can distribute tasks more efficiently and effectively, eliminating the server overload and ensuring the seamless flow of data during peak hours.
