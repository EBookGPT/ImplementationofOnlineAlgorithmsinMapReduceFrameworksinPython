# Chapter 31: Recent Advances in Implementation of Online Algorithms in Map-Reduce

It was a mysterious summer morning in San Francisco when Sherlock Holmes received a letter from his dear friend and computer scientist Sanjay Krishnan.

The letter explained that Sanjay was working on processing large and complex data sets for a research project, and he encountered difficulties in running an online algorithm on a Map-Reduce framework efficiently. He suspected that there might be a bottleneck in the processing pipeline, but he had no clue what the problem might be.

Sanjay begged Holmes to come to his lab, stating that he needed his help to find the root cause of the performance issue. Holmes, being an expert in both online algorithms and Map-Reduce frameworks, accepted the challenge and set out to Sanjay's lab.

Upon his arrival, Sanjay greeted Holmes kindly, and they headed straight to his work station. Holmes observed that the code was processing data in a batch process rather than streaming the data in real-time. This method was causing several processing constraints and resulting in slower performance.

Holmes immediately thought of the Map-Reduce algorithm as the potential solution to the problem. He opened the terminal and wrote a Python code using Map-Reduce to implement online algorithms for real-time processing. 

```python
from collections import deque
from typing import List, Tuple

def mapper(key: int, value: Tuple[int, int], queue: deque) -> None:
    queue.append(value)
    if len(queue) > k:
        queue.popleft()

def reducer(key: int, queue: deque) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    res = []
    for value in queue:
        res.append((key, value))
    return res
```

Holmes explained that the mapper function gets a value in a tuple and appends it to the queue. If the length of the queue exceeds the batch size, k, it removes the oldest value in the queue. The reducer combines all the values for each key into a single list of tuples.

Sanjay was ecstatic! The algorithm worked like a charm, and the bottleneck in the processing pipeline was eliminated. He thanked Holmes for his expertise and explained that this small change will revolutionize his research project.

Holmes responded that the implementation of online algorithms on Map-Reduce frameworks is a rapidly growing area, with new advancements and challenges appearing regularly. He also noted that the use of Python in big data processing and its significant libraries, such as NumPy and Pandas, make it ideal for use in Map-Reduce frameworks.

With a newfound spirit of success, Sanjay and Holmes continued their discussion and exploration of this fascinating field. For Holmes, the joy of solving a technical mystery was always worth the journey.
Sure, I would be happy to explain the code used to resolve the Sherlock Holmes mystery!

In the context of the mystery, Holmes used the Map-Reduce algorithm to implement online algorithms for real-time processing to overcome the bottleneck in the pipeline that Sanjay was experiencing. Here's an explanation of the code used:

```python
from collections import deque
from typing import List, Tuple

def mapper(key: int, value: Tuple[int, int], queue: deque) -> None:
    queue.append(value)
    if len(queue) > k:
        queue.popleft()

def reducer(key: int, queue: deque) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:
    res = []
    for value in queue:
        res.append((key, value))
    return res
```

**The `mapper` function:** 

The `mapper` function takes `key`, `value`, and a `queue` as input arguments. It first appends the `value`, which is a tuple containing two integers, into the `queue`. It then checks if the length of the `queue` is more than the batch size, `k`. If the length of `queue` has exceeded `k`, it removes the oldest value (`value` at the head of the `queue`) using the `popleft()` method.

**The `reducer` function:**

The `reducer` function takes in `key` and `queue` as arguments. It initializes an empty list called `res`. Afterward, for each `value` in the queue, the function appends a tuple of `(key, value)` into the `res` list using the `append()` method. Finally, it returns the `res` list.

This implementation of online algorithms in Map-Reduce framework using Python code works by streaming data in real-time and processing it in batches, avoiding bottlenecks and ensuring faster performance. This code demonstrates a recent advance in implementation of online algorithms in Map-Reduce Frameworks by using Python, specifically collections.deque, in creating an efficient online algorithm.
