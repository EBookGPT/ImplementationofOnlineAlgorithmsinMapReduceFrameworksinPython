# Chapter 4: Map Function in Python

Welcome back, dear reader, as we continue to explore the world of online algorithms in map-reduce frameworks using Python. In the previous chapter, we learned about the basics of the Python programming language and how it can be used in the context of map-reduce.

In this chapter, we will dive deeper into one of the most important functions in Python's map-reduce framework - the Map function. The Map function is used to apply a function to each element in a list or tuple and create a new list of the results. By using the Map function in combination with the reduce and filter functions, you can easily process large datasets and build efficient and scalable algorithms.

Throughout this chapter, we will follow the famous detective Sherlock Holmes as he solves a mystery using the Map function in Python. So, grab your magnifying glass, put on your detective hat, and let's get started!
# Chapter 4: Map Function in Python

## The Case of the Stolen Diamonds

It was a cold and foggy morning in London when Sherlock Holmes received a letter from a wealthy diamond merchant, Mr. Anthony Tudor. The letter explained that Mr. Tudor's safe containing his most precious diamonds had been stolen from his office the night before. Despite having a top-notch security system that should have made the theft impossible, the safe was empty and there were no signs of a forced entry.

Sherlock Holmes knew he had to act fast. He quickly went to the crime scene to investigate and started to gather as much information as he could.

As Holmes studied the safe, he noticed something peculiar. There was a small scratch on the lock of the safe. This made Holmes suspicious and gave him an idea. He realized that the thief may have used a special lock picking algorithm, and made a list of potential suspects based on this assumption.

Holmes decided to use Python's Map function to see if his assumption was correct. He created a function that loops through a list of potential lock picking algorithms and tries each one until the lock is successfully picked. The function used the Map function to apply the lock picking algorithm to each potential combination in the list.

```python
def pick_lock(lock_combinations, lock_picking_algorithm):
    picked_lock = list(map(lock_picking_algorithm, lock_combinations))
    if True in picked_lock:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

Holmes applied this function to his list of potential suspects, each of whom had a different lock picking algorithm. The Map function helped him pick out the suspect whose algorithm successfully picked the lock, leading them to the culprit behind the theft.

## The Resolution

Thanks to Sherlock Holmes' quick thinking and the help of the Map function in Python, the culprit was caught and the stolen diamonds were returned to Mr. Tudor. Holmes had used the power of Map to efficiently test multiple lock picking algorithms, ultimately leading him to the thief.

This case served as a reminder of the importance of using the right tool for the job, and how Python's Map function can be a valuable asset in solving such cases of online algorithms in map-reduce frameworks.

Now that we've seen the Map function in action, it's time to take a closer look at its implementation and explore how it can be used in various real-world scenarios.

## The Code Behind the Solution

Sherlock Holmes used the power of Map function in Python to test different lock picking algorithms and catch the thief behind the stolen diamonds. In this section, let's explore the code used in this solution.

The `pick_lock` function created by Holmes is a straightforward implementation of the Map function in Python. The function takes two arguments: a list of lock combinations, and a function that represents the lock picking algorithm. 

The function uses the following syntax to apply the lock picking algorithm to each combination in the list of lock combinations:

```python
picked_lock = list(map(lock_picking_algorithm, lock_combinations))
```

The `map()` function applies the `lock_picking_algorithm` to each element in `lock_combinations` list and creates a new list of the results. In this case, the returned list `picked_lock` contains boolean values representing whether or not each algorithm successfully opens the lock.

Once the list of boolean values has been created, the function checks if any of the values are `True` using this line of code:

```python
if True in picked_lock:
```

If a `True` value is found, it means the lock was successfully picked with that corresponding lock picking algorithm.

During the investigation, Holmes used this function for each potential suspect, each with a different lock picking algorithm. The suspects were fed into the function as arguments instead of `lock_picking_algorithm`, as such:

```python
pick_lock(lock_combinations, suspect_algorithm)
```

This allowed Holmes to detect whose algorithm was successful, which ultimately led to the capture of the criminal.

And that's how the Map function in Python was used to crack the case in Sherlock Holmes' latest mystery!
