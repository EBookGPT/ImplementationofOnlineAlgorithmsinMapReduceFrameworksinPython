# Chapter 6: The Mysterious Combiner Function in Python

As we come to the sixth chapter of our journey, we stand on the cusp of unraveling yet another mystery. In the last chapter, we were thrilled to have Raymond Hettinger himself as our special guest and learnt the importance of the Reduce function in Python. With that knowledge firmly under our belt, today we embark upon a new adventure--delving deep into the enigmatic world of the Combiner Function in Python.

As we all know, the backbone of MapReduce programming is the MapReduce Framework. The main goal of this framework is to divide the processing of large data sets across a large number of nodes in a cluster. The MapReduce programming model involves two functions: the Mapper function and the Reducer function. Between these two functions lies the much-maligned and little-understood Combiner function.

A Combiner function is used to aggregate intermediate key-value pairs on the map side, which helps in reducing the amount of data transferred between the map and the reduce tasks. This results in faster execution by reducing network traffic and hence the processing time.

In this chapter, we will function as the investigative detectives, and, with the help of Python code, we will uncover the secrets behind the Combiner function. Join us on this exciting adventure as we unravel the mysteries surrounding the Combiner function in Python!
# Chapter 6: The Mysterious Combiner Function in Python

As we were preparing for our sixth chapter, we received a letter from an old friend Raymond Hettinger - Python core developer, and the special guest of our previous chapter. The letter was concerning an unusual case he had stumbled upon that had been perplexing him for weeks.

According to the letter, there had been a massive robbery at the local bank in the town of Pythonia. The robber had escaped, leaving behind a mountain of data. The sheriff had managed to recover the data, but it was in an unmanageable format, requiring a MapReduce program to process it.

Since Hettinger was a trustworthy and reliable old friend, we both agreed to help him put together a MapReduce program that could efficiently manipulate the data to catch the robber. The program required the use of the often-misunderstood Combiner function which Hettinger had determined to be the key to solving this case.

We started by examining the data, and it was a mess. The data consisted of transaction records with the location and the amount. It soon became clear that the data could be grouped by location to make it easier to compare and contrast. We decided to use the Combiner function to merge and sum up transaction records made in the same location.

With Hettinger's guidance, we sprang into action, writing a MapReduce program with the Combiner function. We used the Combiner function to add the amounts of the transactions in the same location, and the reduce function to add the sums of transactions from the same location.

```Python
from typing import List, Tuple
import collections

def mapper(transaction: str) -> Tuple[str, int]:
    """Maps transaction to location and amount"""
    location, amount = transaction.split(',')
    return location, int(amount)

def combiner(transactions: List[int]) -> int:
    """Combines transactions made in the same location"""
    return sum(transactions)

def reducer(location: str, transactions: List[int]) -> Tuple[str, int]:
    """Reduces sums of transactions from the same location"""
    return location, sum(transactions)

transactions = [
    "Pythonia, 10",
    "Rattlesnake-creek, 5",
    "Pythonia, 5",
    "Rattlesnake-creek, 5",
    "Barracuda-bay, 20",
    "Pythonia, 10",
    "Barracuda-bay, 5",
]

location_amounts = collections.defaultdict(list)

for transaction in transactions:
    location, amount = mapper(transaction)
    location_amounts[location].append(amount)

combiner_output = [
    (location, combiner(amounts))
    for location, amounts in location_amounts.items()
]

combiner_output.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])

final_output = []
for location, amounts in itertools.groupby(combiner_output, lambda x: x[0]):
    final_output.append(reducer(location, [amount for _, amount in amounts]))

print(final_output)
```

After testing our program, the results spoke for themselves. We were able to successfully sort the transaction amounts and group transactions by their locations, making it vastly easier to identify patterns and discover the robber's location.

As we all enjoyed a refreshing drink to celebrate our recent success, Raymond Hettinger put down his drink and expressed his gratitude for our help in cracking the case. He tipped his cap to the often-misunderstood Combiner function, which had made it all possible.

With the Combiner function finally under our belts, we were now equipped to tackle more complex cases with even greater confidence. And so, our adventure in the MapReduce Framework continues, with yet more challenges to come.
In this chapter, we were introduced to the Combiner function in Python and its importance in Processing data in a MapReduce Framework.

We were presented with an exciting case of a bank robbery with large quantities of unmanaged data, which we had to sort and process by location. We wrote a MapReduce program with the help of the special guest, Python core developer Raymond Hettinger.

The MapReduce program uses three main functions:

1. The `mapper` function which maps the location and the amount from the transaction
   ```Python
   def mapper(transaction: str) -> Tuple[str, int]:
        location, amount = transaction.split(',')
        return location, int(amount)
  ```

2. The `combiner` function, which combines the transactions made in the same location by summing the amounts.
    ```Python
    def combiner(transactions: List[int]) -> int:
        return sum(transactions)
  ```

3. The `reducer` function, which sums the transaction amounts made in the same location.
   ```Python
   def reducer(location: str, transactions: List[int]) -> Tuple[str, int]:
        return location, sum(transactions)
  ```

The `defaultdict` data structure is used to group transactions by location in the code block below:
```Python
location_amounts = collections.defaultdict(list)

for transaction in transactions:
    location, amount = mapper(transaction)
    location_amounts[location].append(amount)
```

The output of `location_amounts` is then used by the `combiner` function which returns a new list of tuples where each tuple contains a location, and the sum of the amounts for the same location:
```Python
combiner_output = [
    (location, combiner(amounts))
    for location, amounts in location_amounts.items()
]
```

Finally, the `combiner_output` is reduced with `reducer` to produce the final output - a list of tuples where each tuple contains a location and its corresponding sum of transaction amounts in that location.
```Python
final_output = []
for location, amounts in itertools.groupby(combiner_output, lambda x: x[0]):
    final_output.append(reducer(location, [amount for _, amount in amounts]))

print(final_output)
```

With the successful execution of our program, we were able to catch the robber and solve the case. With this, we have successfully added another tool to our arsenal of MapReduce programming, which will surely help us tackle more complex cases with ease.
