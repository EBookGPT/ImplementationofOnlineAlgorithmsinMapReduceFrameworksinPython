# Chapter 19: Anomaly Detection Algorithms in Python

_Developer's Note_: Welcome back, dear reader! I hope you enjoyed the previous chapter on Dimension Reduction algorithms. We had a marvelous time learning about Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) with none other than our esteemed special guest Charu Aggarwal!

In this chapter, we are going to dive deep into the world of anomaly detection. But before we do that, let's take a step back and revisit the basics of anomaly detection.

Anomaly detection is the task of identifying data points that deviate from the norm in a given dataset. The identification of such anomalies can often provide critical insights into the behavior of a system or process. Such outbreaks can speed up maintenance schedules, alert alerts for system failures, and reduce costs.

There are several anomaly detection algorithms in use today, each with its unique advantages and disadvantages. In this chapter, we will focus on implementing these algorithms on Map-Reduce frameworks using Python. 

So, fasten your seatbelts, and join me for a thrilling ride filled with mystery and discovery as we uncover the secrets of Anomaly Detection in Python!
# Chapter 19: Anomaly Detection Algorithms in Python

_Developer's Note_: Welcome back, dear reader! I hope you enjoyed the introduction to Anomaly Detection.

Our story begins with our favorite detective, Sherlock Holmes, receiving a distress call from the Ministry of Defense. The officials there were deeply concerned about the large amounts of data they were collecting on military equipment, and possible defects that could emerge. They suspected some of the equipment might require frequent repairs and replacement, thereby, adding a substantial cost to their budget.

Sherlock took up the challenge and set about analyzing the data, which was present in a large file. He soon realized that the amount and size of the data made it difficult to process the file using the conventional approach. That's when he remembered Map-Reduce frameworks and called Charu Aggarwal, a famous data scientist, for help.

To tackle the problem, Charu suggested that Sherlock use the anomaly detection algorithm. She observed that faulty equipment could be treated as anomalies and identified in the data. Charu also explained that there are several ways to do that. Depending on the data's nature, one could use either supervised or unsupervised anomalies detection algorithms.

Sherlock was fascinated by Charu's explanation and requested her to demonstrate how to implement such algorithms in Python. Charu began by explaining the unsupervised anomaly detection algorithm, which is commonly used when there are no labeled data. 

 She demonstrated the implementation of Isolation Forests, one of the most popular unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms, which utilizes decision tree techniques.

```
#Importing the Required Libraries
from sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

#load dataset
data=pd.read_csv('military_equipment.csv')

#fit the model
IF = IsolationForest(contamination=.1, random_state=1234)
IF.fit(data)

#predict outliers
data['is_outlier'] = IF.predict(data)
```

After implementing the Isolation Forest algorithm, all the anomalous data points were identified. Sherlock was amazed by the results and thanked Charu for her help in solving the case. With the identified anomalies, the military was able to take preventive measures and reduce repair costs significantly.

_Developer's Note_: And that, dear reader, is how Sherlock and Charu used their combined expertise to find a solution to the Ministry of Defense's problem. Anomaly detection in Python is a powerful tool, and we hope this chapter was as intriguing and engaging as a good Sherlock Holmes mystery. Until next time!
# Explanation of Code

In this chapter, we explored the unsupervised anomaly detection algorithm to identify faulty equipment in a Ministry of Defense dataset. The unsupervised anomaly detection algorithm, as explained by Charu, uses unlabeled data to identify anomalies. The algorithm aims to build a model of "normal" behavior and then identify any data points which don't fit that model as an anomaly.

To demonstrate the unsupervised anomaly detection algorithm, Charu suggested the use of Isolation Forests, a popular algorithm for detecting anomalies.

The code below shows how to implement Isolation Forest in Python using the Scikit-learn library:

```python
#Importing the Required Libraries
from sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

#load dataset
data=pd.read_csv('military_equipment.csv')

#fit the model
IF = IsolationForest(contamination=.1, random_state=1234)
IF.fit(data)

#predict outliers
data['is_outlier'] = IF.predict(data)
```

The first step is to import the required libraries. We import the Isolation Forest algorithm from Sci-kit Learn, as well as pandas and numpy. Once we have loaded our dataset using Pandas, we are ready to apply the algorithm.

The next step is to fit the Isolation Forest model to our data. We use the `fit()` method of the `IsolationForest` class to fit the model on our data. The `contamination` parameter determines the proportion of outliers in the dataset. Here, we have set it to 0.1, which means that the algorithm will identify 10% of the data as anomalies. The `random_state` parameter is used to set the seed for the random number generator that is used by the algorithm.

Finally, we predict the outliers using the `predict()` method of the `IsolationForest` class. We then append the `is_outlier` column to the original dataset, which contains the predicted values of whether the data point is an outlier or not.

In conclusion, the code above demonstrates how easily we can detect anomalies using the Isolation Forest algorithm in Python. By identifying these anomalies, we can take preventive measures and reduce the overall repair costs.
