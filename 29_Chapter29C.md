# Chapter 29: Case Studies

Welcome to the final chapter of our book on Implementation of Online Algorithms in Map-Reduce Frameworks in Python. Throughout this book, we have explored various concepts related to implementing online algorithms in Map-Reduce frameworks such as Hadoop and Spark. We have also covered the basics of Python programming and how to use Python to implement these algorithms.

In this final chapter, we will apply the knowledge we have gained over the previous chapters to explore some real-world case studies. We will look at how online algorithms and Map-Reduce frameworks have been used to solve various problems across different industries. 

We'll be using the powerful combination of Hadoop and Python to implement these case studies. We'll be diving into the Python code and the Map-Reduce framework, so make sure you're comfortable with both of them.

By studying these case studies, we hope you will become confident in writing your own online algorithms in a Map-Reduce framework using Python. So without further ado, let's gear up to explore the case studies that we have for you!

## The Case of the Fraudulent Insurance Claims

Sherlock Holmes, the renowned detective, received a call from a leading insurance company. The company was facing a major issue of fraudulent insurance claims. The management was worried that they would be financially ruined if this problem persisted. Sherlock Holmes was called upon to solve the case.

Holmes quickly got to work, and after analyzing the data shared by the insurance company, he realized that they needed a system to detect unusual patterns in the data. He also realized that this system needed to be scalable since the data was growing at an exponential rate.

Luckily, Holmes had read our book and implemented an online algorithm for anomaly detection in a Map-Reduce framework. He coded the algorithm in Python and deployed it on a Hadoop cluster.

Using this algorithm, Holmes was able to detect unusual patterns in the insurance claims data. Within a few days, he was able to mark dubious claims, and after thorough verification by the insurance company, he was able to identify a group of people who were responsible for the fraudulent claims. The insurance company was saved from financial ruin.

## The Resolution

The key takeaway from this case study is that Map-Reduce frameworks can be extremely powerful when used in conjunction with online algorithms. The ability to process large amounts of data in a scalable manner makes these frameworks ideal for fraud detection, anomaly detection, and many other similar applications.

By using online algorithms, Holmes was able to detect fraudulent insurance claims in real-time, which enabled the company to take prompt actions, thus saving them from significant financial loss. Python, Hadoop, and the Map-Reduce framework were the tools that enabled Holmes to achieve this feat.

This case study highlights the value of using online algorithms and Map-Reduce frameworks for detecting anomalies in large datasets, and how it can help solve real-world problems. It also underscores the importance of having a good understanding of Python programming to implement these algorithms in a Map-Reduce framework.

## Explaining the Code

In order to solve the case of the fraudulent insurance claims, Sherlock Holmes had to use a combination of Python, Hadoop, and Map-Reduce frameworks. Here's how he implemented the online algorithm in Python to detect unusual patterns in the insurance claims data:

```python
from mrjob.job import MRJob
import statistics as stats


class AnomalyDetection(MRJob):
    
    def mapper(self, _, line):
        data = line.split(",")
        # assuming data in format <claim_id>, <user_id>, <amount>
        yield data[1], float(data[2])
        
    def combiner(self, user_id, amounts):
        amount_list = list(amounts)
        # calculating median
        median = stats.median(amount_list)
        # calculating median absolute deviation
        mad = stats.median([abs(amount - median) for amount in amount_list])
        for amount in amount_list:
            if abs(amount - median) > 3 * mad:
                yield user_id, (amount, median, mad)
                
    def reducer(self, user_id, anomalies):
        for anomaly in anomalies:
            yield user_id, anomaly
            
if __name__ == '__main__':
    AnomalyDetection.run()
```

The code above is an implementation of the online algorithm for anomaly detection in a Map-Reduce framework using the MRJob library.

In the mapper function, we split the input data into its components - claim_id, user_id, and amount. We then yield the user_id and amount as key-value pairs.

In the combiner function, we receive the key-value pairs from the mapper, group them by user_id, and calculate the median and median absolute deviation (MAD) for each user. We then iterate over the amounts and check if the difference between them and the median is greater than three times the MAD. If it is, we yield the user_id along with the amount, median, and MAD as key-value pairs.

In the reducer function, we receive the key-value pairs from the combiner and yield the user_id along with the anomalies detected.

By using this implementation in conjunction with Hadoop and Map-Reduce frameworks, Sherlock Holmes was able to analyze large amounts of insurance claims data and detect unusual patterns in real-time. This enabled him to detect fraudulent claims and identify the individuals responsible for them.
