# Chapter 25 - Distributed Deep Learning using Python and Map-Reduce

Greetings, dear reader! In this chapter, we bring to you the magical world of Distributed Deep Learning using Python and Map-Reduce. 

As we know, Deep Learning (DL) is a subset of Machine Learning that involves training Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) on huge datasets, which needs a humongous amount of computational power. When it comes to distributed systems, this computational power is achieved using multiple machines connected in a network. 

Map-Reduce is a paradigm that allows us to tackle large-scale data processing by splitting it into smaller chunks and processing them in parallel. The Map function takes a set of data and converts it into another set of data, where each element is broken down into key-value pairs. The Reduce function then takes the output generated by the Map function, performs a summary operation, and generates the final result. 

In this chapter, we combine the power of Deep Learning and Map-Reduce to show you how to train large-scale neural networks efficiently. We have a special guest, Yann LeCun, a legend in the field of DL, who will guide you on this exciting journey. 

So, dear reader, let's dive into the world of Distributed Deep Learning using Python and Map-Reduce and unveil the mysteries that lie within.
# Chapter 25 - Distributed Deep Learning using Python and Map-Reduce

## The Mystery

Sherlock Holmes was sitting in his Baker Street flat, staring at the wall. Dr. Watson walked in and asked, "What are you thinking about, Holmes?"

Holmes replied, "I have been trying to solve a mystery. There is a deep learning project that has come to a screeching halt. They were training a massive neural network using Python and Map-Reduce, but something went wrong, and now they cannot seem to get it to work. They have tried everything, but the neural network is just not learning."

Perplexed, Watson asked, "And why are you thinking about the mystery, Holmes?"

"Because there is something strange about the project," Holmes replied. "The team has already trained smaller neural networks using the same framework, and they were efficient. But this huge neural network, which they had split into many chunks, has baffled them. The data they are using is clean, and they have a dedicated cluster of machines to speed up the process, yet it is not working. It is as if the machines are fighting against each other."

Watson raised an eyebrow, "This is very curious. Do you think we can solve this mystery, Holmes?"

With a glint in his eye, Holmes replied, "Indeed, Watson. Let us put our thinking caps on and solve this mystery once and for all."

## The Solution

Holmes and Watson headed to the project site and spoke to the team. They looked at the code and tried to understand the problem's root cause. After days of analysis, they found an issue - every time they passed the data between the Map and Reduce phase, they were loading and unloading the data from the hard disk, causing the machines' lag. This was causing a slowdown in the neural network's ability to train, and as the data set grew larger, the slowdown became more pronounced.

Holmes suggested that they run the entire neural network on each machine, and use a collective aggregation approach instead of splitting it into smaller chunks. The team immediately implemented Holmes' suggestion, and to their amazement, the neural network began to converge much faster than before. The data was not being passed repeatedly between the machines, as they were now working together with minimum lag.

Yann LeCun joined Holmes in congratulating the team and appreciated Holmes' brilliant deduction. Yann was amazed at the speed of the neural network and the reduction in the computational burden.

Holmes and Watson left the project site, knowing they had solved another mystery. With the power of Distributed Deep Learning using Python and Map-Reduce and our special guest Yann LeCun, we too can solve any mystery that comes our way.

## The Code Solution

To tackle the issue in the Sherlock Holmes mystery, we must employ a collective aggregation approach instead of splitting the neural network into smaller chunks. To do this, we will make use of PyTorch DDP(Distributed Data-Parallel) module.

#### Step 1: Initialize DDP

We will initialize DDP by defining the process group and giving each instance a rank.

```python
import torch
import torch.distributed as dist
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from torch.nn.parallel import DistributedDataParallel as DDP
from torch.utils.data.distributed import DistributedSampler

# initialize the process group
dist.init_process_group(backend="nccl", rank=args.local_rank, world_size=args.world_size)

# select the GPU
torch.cuda.set_device(args.local_rank)

# create the model
model = MyNetwork()
model.cuda(args.local_rank)

# make the model DDP
model = DDP(model, device_ids=[args.local_rank], output_device=args.local_rank)
```

#### Step 2: Adjust Batch Size and Sampler

In the case of a large dataset, the batch size needs to be adjusted as we must ensure that we do not run out of memory. This is done by reducing the batch size on each process. We also need to use Distributed Sampler to ensure we have randomly sampled data.

```python
train_sampler = DistributedSampler(train_dataset, num_replicas=args.world_size, rank=args.local_rank, shuffle=True)
```

#### Step 3: Optimize with AdamW

We use AdamW optimization to improve training performance.

```python
optimizer = optim.AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=learning_rate, weight_decay=0.1)
```

#### Step 4: Implement Distributed Training

```python
model.train()

for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    train_sampler.set_epoch(epoch)

    for data in train_loader:
        # distribute data across devices
        inputs, labels = data[0].to(device), data[1].to(device)

        # compute loss
        outputs = model(inputs)
        loss = criterion(outputs, labels)

        # compute gradients
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        loss.backward()

        # aggregate gradients across all processes
        nn.utils.clip_grad_norm_(model.parameters(), max_norm=gradient_clip_value)
        optimizer.step()

        # print statistics
        if (i + 1) % print_interval == 0:
            print(f"Epoch [{epoch+1}/{num_epochs}], Step [{i+1}/{steps_per_epoch}], Loss: {loss.item():.4f}")
```

Thus, by following these steps, we can implement Distributed Deep Learning using Python and Map-Reduce and solve the mystery that perplexed even Sherlock Holmes!
